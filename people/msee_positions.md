## Organizational Positions

As with any operational environment the software engineering enterprise also requires an administrative and functional hierarchy.  Aside from a reporting aparatus the administrative structure serves to provide feedback and mentorship opportunities, promoting (and rewarding) personal growth.  The functional structure is required to manage, as in oversight, the organization's many projects and efforts from a technical perspective - aligning skills and business requirements.  There a couple key roles in this regard worth identifying and discussing: the software architect and the chief engineer.

### The Software Architect

The software architect role is one centered around skills, usually in a specific area - databases, networking, metrics and monitoring, services.  The architect should have a solid understanding of industry standards, and practices as well as a solid ability to relate them to business requirements.  Architects are critical in young projects, projects requiring major transitions in functionality, and efforts where integration with external systems is required.  In most cases architects are practitioners as well, having an ability to work within cross-functional teams to coordinate and make decisions on critical points regarding technical options.

### The Chief Engineer

The role of the chief engineer is one that has transcended very large federal engineering projects that include many sub-contractors, and many different sub-projects, all leading up to a top-level distributable delivery within a complex process methodology.  The role of the chief engineer in an IT organization is not at all dissimilar.  And to a degree this role is similar to what is covered by an Chief Information Officer or Chief Technical Officer.  The main function of the chief engineer is oversight - of all things people, process and technology.  The intent of the oversight is simple, deliver quality on/in time, in the most maintainable means possible with least amount of duplication or technical debt.
