## Agile (& Processes Always Evolve)

Agile methodologies have been a boon for software engineering and organizations who are required to be responsive to their customers (and the market in general).  The ability to drive development in the direction of the highest value is incredibly important.

The methodology itself, isn't as important as many of the pragmatic practices[^agile1].  Practices like planning and continuous integration combined with notions like developer respect, and continuous delivery help raise agile to places where it's a requisite - even when combined with other process-stringent requirements.

But, the most important aspect for the modern software engineering enterprise is the need for the processes to evolve, based on stakeholder feedback, just as softwares being engineered do.  Testing requirements change, customers themselves come and go, and the software artifacts evolve - requiring that the processes be adaptable and extensible to continue towards optimization.  Agile methods must be agile themselves.

One component of agile often gets shortchanged is testing - even as it is the most critical piece.  Developers often see testing as a basic function, that ends with a minimal set of integrations (do their developed interfaces meet the specifications?).  Because of the void that is created once software successfully completes integration testing - developers wash their hands and move on to the next task.  Generally accountability for the operation of the software is released to operations staff, or an external customer.  The challenge is that it is rare for software to behave the same in development and test environments as it does in production (or in the hands of the customer).  Developers typically focus on 'happy' paths, based on their understanding of the target environment(s).  Enter DevOps, as discussed in this paper, as a cultural movement to establish better relationships between all stakeholders (in the engineering continuum).
