## Waterfall

For most software engineers the thought of waterfall-based projects means slow progress, driven by lengthy requirements and design steps - the world of systems engineers and big-design-up-front (BDUF).  For some projects this is an inescapable methodology due to delivery, customer-driven requirements and contracting, but note: even in enterprises that are bound by waterfall-based methodologies, continuous delivery is still possible.  In these cases, 'production-ready' is the objective.  This means that deliverables should be ready for shipping at any specified point in time - daily or weekly.  Even if the end product is only delivered to customers on a quarterly (or longer) schedule any subcomponents can be pipelined to points in each stage, making it ready for consumption or testing downstream.

Ultimately, within waterfall there is a greater emphasis up-front and during integration.  By having components readily available (automatically built and tested) they can be continuous integrated in systems and functionally tested still.  The point being that the actual methodology of design, development and delivery is only benefited by being capable of managing against change and automating as deeply as possible towards continuous delivery of artifacts.
