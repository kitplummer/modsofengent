## Technical Debt

The ideas behind the notion of technical debt[^technicaldebt1] aren't necessarily new, they are just now being integrated into risk management planning, and development and generally IT operations.  The basic premise is that every project, through decisions on technology, feature priorities, delivery pipelines, and feedback cycles incurs debt (in the form of more work to be done) over time.  Of course some debts are manageable and some debts end up out of the control of project staff, and oversight efforts.  Upstream changes, new technologies, new processes, new requirements and most often, changes in priorities will effort a projects level of debt.

One of the challenges for the modern software engineering enterprise is how to limit technical debt as much as possible.  While likely impossible to not incur debt, the ability to identify it early, and understand the impacts will affect the overall health of the project.

In order to best manage technical debt, all stakeholders must understand the project's requirements and immediate priorities.  With a common understanding the project team can then work to ensure the backlog of work is managed in advance of work allocation - creating tasks for investigation, identifying costs for change, costs for not changing, and rationalizing termination or complete rewrites.

Maintenance is probably the biggest factor associated with technical debt, that isn't fully understood as the products or services are released.  In a lot of cases, what was the optimum solution for production performance isn't the easiest thing to maintain - incurring operational costs, and slowing developmental advances.  Refactoring for maintenance can be really difficult, and eventually requires higher-level staff (and thus more debt).

Other major debt concerns are upstream dependency health, technology evolution, platform and operating system requirements, and lack of extensibility.
