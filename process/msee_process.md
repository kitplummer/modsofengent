# Process and Methodologies

The discussion of process and methodologies is an infinite one.  But there are a few unrefutable truths - all centered around organizational agility and changing markets.

The modern software engineering enterprise must be quick and extensible enough in order to deliver on time, the right product, with the ability assure quality.  The use of complete Agile methods, or even just agile practices will help an organization support cultural requirements, and allow for the appropriate technologies to be used - nevermind an opportunity for feedback to drive the continued development of products and services.

Master planned, but project tuned - organizations need to ensure that each project has the flexibility to optimize the processes for their specific needs.  That said, there's still a need for the organization to provide certain oversight and controls around the path to production to ensure all objectives are met.

There is a lot of discussion about "lean" and whether or not Agile methods can be combined with more rigid process structures (e.g. CMMI).  It is probably safe to say that any organization can tailor any suite or processes or methods to meet there needs.  The modern enterprise is willing to invest, and reinvest in the evolution of all efforts - especially when they work towards a culture of change management.

There are a few focused aspects that need to be called out: supply-chains, waterfall and agile, technical-debt, architecture, development, and audit - as they all impact the ability for an organization to accept and control change.
