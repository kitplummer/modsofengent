# Pragmatic Practices

## Top 10 List of Things an Enterprise Should Be Doing (not in any order)

1. Development environments that replicate production (based on captured requirements that drive or derive from production systems), allowing for continuous delivery (possibly deployment)

2. Automate the functional (performance, security, etc.) testing environment, based on dynamically provisioned resources

3. Centrally manage ingress and produced artifacts in a controlled repository for all development languages and frameworks (Java, Python, Ruby, etc.)

4. Establish an open and sharing culture for developers with a social-coding platform (internal or externally managed) like Github

5. Adopt a "right tool for the job" mentality - allowing projects the flexibility to go through the decision-making process for down-selection of tools.

6. Investigate deeply, the architectural infrastructure that best suits the long-term development and maintenance of all software projects (e.g. microservices, versus monolithic applications)

7. Provide suites of tools consistently to all projects (enterprise-managed issue/task tracking, source code management, testing infrastructure, self-service virtual machines, etc.) to allow for continuity and developer confidence

8. Remove walls between functional/operational staff, bringing the right skills to the projects early - specifically developers, operators, security and qa, and business analyst early and continuously through the lifecycle

9. Design infrastructure and software for measurement and metrics-based management up-front - providing operators with the tools required to automate the feedback loop

10. Support rewrites or termination of legacy products and services when the technical debt associated with them weighs more than the replacement effort.
