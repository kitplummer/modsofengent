# TLDR; nee Executive Summary

The pace of change in the software world has created nightmare for IT shops and engineering functions within small and large organizations alike.  Dependency complexity combined with the turnover of new technologies is escalating the need for greater software supply chain awareness and control.  Software engineering enterprises, organizations who design and develop software solutions for internal or external consumer use, are faced with the need for modern practices and tools - before they succumb to overwhelming technical debt and security vulnerabilities.

It takes a combination of culture, agile and dynamic processes, and evolving organization-wide services and tools for modern enterprises to manage proactively the aforementioned challenges.  The engineering culture must include analysts, developers, administrators, and operators who are continuously in control of the supply chain, performance and security requirements, and changes in available technologies.  More importantly, a workforce that is happily willing to work together without barriers during the lifespan of software systems.  The enterprise must engender a sense of leadership with well-defined processes that continuously evolve to enable pragmatic practices and methods - while providing auditable control.  The enterprise must adopt a "right tool for the job" approach, and enlist and grow the skills required to use those tools.  Monitoring and measurement of all of the software must be a hard requirement, and integral in the design, implementation and maintenance of the system.  Infrastructure and resources must be uniformly available for architects, developers, testers and operators to collaborate towards an efficient delivery apparatus that includes both production, development and test environments.
